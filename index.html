            Okonma's music is primarily rooted in alternative hip hop, hip hop, bedroom pop,
            jazz rap, R&B, and neo soul, while his earlier music was considered horrorcore.
            Over the years, his style of production has progressed from gritty and dark in
            early projects to a jazzy and soulful approach with the albums Cherry Bomb, Flower
            Boy, and Igor. His lyrical themes have also evolved from horrorcore-esque subjects
            to views on love, sexuality, existence and nostalgia.

              Tyler has identified as an atheist and has had explicitly anti-religious lyrics
              in his music, especially on the mixtape, Bastard, and the album, Goblin. He has
              been an avid skateboarder since 2002 and collects BMX bicycles. Tyler has been
              the subject of speculation regarding his sexuality and has made numerous direct
              references in lyrics and interviews to having had same-sex relationships or
              experiencing same-sex attractions. In November 2018, Jaden Smith announced that
              he was in a relationship with Tyler, the Creator. Tyler does not drink alcohol or
              use any mind-altering substances and admits to having tried cannabis twice in his
              life.
